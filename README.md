# Extracellular recordings from the H1-cell of the blowfly
The goal of the week is to record from the motion-sensitive H1-cell of the blowfly (_Calliphora vicina_ or similar) visual system, and perform the adaptation experiment that is described in Brenner et al. (2000). This experiment gives you a good idea of how sensory systems respond and adapt to the statistical properties of the stimulus.
